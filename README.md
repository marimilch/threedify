# threedify
3D-Button Hover Effect for JS

## Usage
1. Include this file as a module in your webpage.

2. ```threedify(".myBoxWithButtons")``` will search in ```.myBoxWithButtons``` for immediate elements with class ```threed``` to apply the effect to.

Unfortunately, transitions cannot be applied to the buttons then, but I will work on it :)

The function defaults to ```body``` as parent, which is not recommended to use.
