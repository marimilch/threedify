# threedify
3D-Button Hover Effect for JS

## Usage
1. Include threedify.js as a module and threedify.css as a stylesheet in your webpage.

2. ```threedify(".myBoxWithButtons", "850px")``` will search in ```.myBoxWithButtons``` for immediate elements with class ```threed``` to apply the effect to. ```850px``` will set the perspective to 850px. Default is 700, so the parameter is optional.

Transitions can be be overridden with ```:hover```, ```:active``` and so on.

The function defaults to ```body``` as parent, which is not recommended to use.
